# weaver-interface-metafont
A METAFONT Submodule  for Weaver Game Engine

This project is part of [Weaver Game
Engine](https://github.com/thiagoharry/weaver). It implements
WeaveFont, a language to desing typographical fonts strongly based on
[Knuth's METAFONT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont).

WeaveFont do not produce single typographical fonts. Instead, each
WeaverFont source file can generate on-the-fly an infinity of
different typographical fonts, just changing some parameters. For
example, with a single source file, you could set the described font
size to 13pt, set 75% of bold, 10% of italics and toggle monospace mode.
